# Go runtime   
Memory Management:   
- Garbage Collection: Yes, this is a key function.   
- Memory Allocation: The runtime handles memory allocation, including the management of stacks for goroutines.   
   
Goroutine Scheduling:   
- The runtime includes a sophisticated scheduler that manages the execution of goroutines across available OS threads.   
   
Concurrency Support:   
- Channel Operations: The runtime implements the mechanics of channel communication.   
- Select Statement: It manages the complex logic behind select statements.   
   
System Calls:   
- The runtime provides a layer of abstraction over system calls, making them more efficient and easier to use across different operating systems.   
   
Stack Management:   
- It handles growing and shrinking of goroutine stacks as needed.   
   
Defer Mechanism:   
- The runtime manages the execution of deferred function calls.   
   
Type System Support:   
- It provides runtime support for Go's type system, including type assertions and reflections.   
   
Networking:   
- The runtime includes non-blocking I/O operations and network polling.   
   
OS Thread Management:   
- It manages the relationship between goroutines and OS threads.
